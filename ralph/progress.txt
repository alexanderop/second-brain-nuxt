# Ralph Progress Log
Started: 2026-01-17

## Codebase Patterns
- Utils go in `app/utils/` as pure TypeScript functions
- Unit tests follow pattern `tests/unit/utils/<name>.test.ts`
- Tests use vitest with `describe`, `expect`, `it` imports
- Non-null assertions (`!`) used for array index access in strict mode

## US-001: Cosine Similarity Function (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2026-01-17

**Files created:**
- `app/utils/cosineSimilarity.ts` - Pure function for computing cosine similarity between vectors
- `tests/unit/utils/cosineSimilarity.test.ts` - 11 unit tests covering all acceptance criteria

**Implementation notes:**
- Function handles 384-dimension vectors efficiently (under 10ms)
- Returns 0 for zero vectors instead of NaN
- Throws descriptive error for vector length mismatch
- All tests pass, typecheck passes

**Next steps:**
- US-002 depends on this for computing embeddings similarity
- US-003 will use this function in the semantic search composable

---

## US-002: Embedding Generation Script (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2026-01-17

**Files created:**
- `scripts/generate-embeddings.ts` - Build script using Transformers.js to generate embeddings
- `public/embeddings.json` - Generated embeddings file (248 entries)

**Package changes:**
- Added `@huggingface/transformers` dependency
- Added `generate:embeddings` script to package.json

**Implementation notes:**
- Uses `Xenova/bge-small-en-v1.5` model for 384-dimension embeddings
- Processes title + summary + first 512 chars of body
- Excludes same directories as OG image script (authors, pages, podcasts, etc.)
- Strips markdown syntax from body text before embedding
- Output format: `{ version, model, embeddings: { [slug]: { vector, title, type } } }`
- Script processes ~250 files in reasonable time
- All tests pass, typecheck passes

**Next steps:**
- US-003 (semantic search composable) will load embeddings.json and use cosine similarity
- US-004 (hybrid search) will combine keyword and semantic scores
- US-007 will add this to prebuild script

---

## US-003: Semantic Search Composable (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2026-01-17

**Files created:**
- `app/composables/useSemanticSearch.ts` - Composable for semantic search against pre-computed embeddings

**Implementation notes:**
- Lazy-loads Transformers.js only when search is first performed
- Fetches and caches embeddings.json on first search
- Converts search query to embedding using bge-small-en-v1.5 model
- Computes cosine similarity against all pre-computed embeddings
- Returns top N results (default 20) sorted by similarity score
- Caches model instance at module level after first load
- Exposes `isLoading` ref for model initialization state
- Exposes `error` ref for failure handling
- Uses Promise-based caching to prevent duplicate model loading
- All tests pass, typecheck passes

**Next steps:**
- US-004 (hybrid search) will combine keyword and semantic scores
- US-005 will integrate this into the search page
- US-006 will integrate this into the command palette

---

## US-004: Hybrid Search Scoring (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2026-01-17

**Files created:**
- `app/utils/hybridSearch.ts` - Utility for combining keyword and semantic search scores
- `tests/unit/utils/hybridSearch.test.ts` - 16 unit tests covering all acceptance criteria

**Implementation notes:**
- Weights: KEYWORD_WEIGHT = 0.4, SEMANTIC_WEIGHT = 0.6
- `computeHybridScore(keywordScore, semanticScore)` - applies weight formula
- `mergeSearchResults(keywordResults, semanticResults)` - merges and deduplicates by slug
- Keyword-only results get semanticScore = 0
- Semantic-only results get keywordScore = 0
- Results sorted by hybrid score descending
- Type information preserved from semantic results
- All tests pass (521 total), typecheck passes

**Next steps:**
- US-005 will integrate this into the search page with useSemanticSearch
- US-006 will integrate this into the command palette

---

## US-005: Integrate Semantic Search into Search Page (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2026-01-17

**Files modified:**
- `app/pages/search.vue` - Integrated useSemanticSearch composable and hybrid scoring

**Implementation notes:**
- Added imports for `useSemanticSearch` and `mergeSearchResults`
- Created reactive refs to track semantic search results and loading state
- Added watch on debouncedSearch to trigger semantic search alongside Fuse.js
- Converted Fuse.js results to KeywordResult format (normalizing 0-1 score to 1-0 scale)
- Uses `mergeSearchResults` to combine keyword and semantic results with hybrid scoring
- Falls back to keyword-only results if semantic search hasn't completed or fails
- Added loading indicator showing "Loading semantic search..." while model initializes
- Shows inline "(semantic search loading...)" in results count during model load
- Author results handled separately (not part of hybrid scoring)
- Existing keyboard navigation (j/k/enter) continues to work unchanged
- All tests pass (521), typecheck passes

**Next steps:**
- US-006 will integrate semantic search into the command palette (AppSearchModal.vue)
- US-007 will add embeddings generation to build pipeline

## US-006: Integrate Semantic Search into Command Palette (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2026-01-17

**Files modified:**
- `app/components/AppSearchModal.vue` - Integrated useSemanticSearch composable and hybrid scoring

**Implementation notes:**
- Added imports for `useSemanticSearch`, `mergeSearchResults`, and `Fuse`
- Added `searchTerm` ref bound to `v-model:search-term` on UCommandPalette
- Used `watchDebounced` to debounce search term (200ms) before triggering semantic search
- Created internal Fuse.js instance for content items to compute keyword scores
- Converted Fuse.js results to KeywordResult format (normalizing 0-1 score to 1-0 scale)
- Uses `mergeSearchResults` to combine keyword and semantic results with hybrid scoring
- Content group uses `ignoreFilter: true` when searching to bypass UCommandPalette's built-in Fuse.js
- Shows loading indicator in group label: "Notes (loading semantic...)" during model initialization
- Falls back to keyword-only results if semantic search hasn't completed or fails
- Resets search state when modal closes
- Authors, newsletters, and podcasts continue using built-in Fuse.js search (not semantic)
- All tests pass (521), typecheck passes

**Next steps:**
- US-007 will add embeddings generation to build pipeline
