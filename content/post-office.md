## Overview

Henry Chinaski takes a job as a mail carrier in Los Angeles, expecting it to be temporary. Twelve years later, he's still there. The novel chronicles his battles with supervisors, grueling routes, and a system designed to grind down anyone with a pulse.

## Key Themes

- **Work as dehumanization** — The post office represents any soul-crushing job where the goal is survival, not fulfillment
- **Resistance through vice** — Drinking, gambling, and women serve as Chinaski's rebellion against respectability
- **Anti-ambition** — Success means getting through another day, not climbing any ladder

## Connections

Shares themes of alienation with [[the-stranger]] and [[no-longer-human]] — protagonists who exist outside conventional society and its expectations.
