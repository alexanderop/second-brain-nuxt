## The Luck Surface Area Formula

Luck isn't random—it's a function of action and visibility:

**Luck = [Doing Things] × [Telling People]**

Both factors multiply each other. Doing great work in silence limits opportunity. Broadcasting nothing means there's nothing to amplify. The intersection creates exponential returns.

## How to Expand Your Surface Area

**Define your work.** Start projects aligned with curiosity or professional expertise. Side projects, work learnings, experiments—anything you can point to and say "I made this."

**Overcome the fear of sharing.** Publishing is a learnable skill. Don't wait for perfection. Share progress, failures, and discoveries along the way.

**Choose your platform.** Publish anywhere outside your hard drive: Twitter, GitHub, newsletters, blogs, podcasts, or communities where your audience gathers. The medium matters less than the act of making work visible.

**Capture the opportunities that follow.** As visibility grows, expect unexpected benefits: job inquiries, client requests, speaking invitations, professional recognition.

## The Multiplier Effect

For every critic, ten people follow along quietly and admire the work. The visible negative feedback overstates the true ratio of supporters to detractors.
