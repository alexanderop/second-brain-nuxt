## Overview

100 Meters (2025) is a Japanese animated sports drama adapted from Uoto's manga "Hyakuemu". The film uses rotoscope animation, filming actual professional runners and animating over them, resulting in remarkably natural movement.

## Key Themes

- **Motivation** — What drives us to push our limits in a race that lasts less than 10 seconds
- **Rivalry as Growth** — How competition with others reveals and develops our true potential
- **The Moment** — Finding meaning in brief, intense experiences

## Why It Matters

The film premiered at Annecy 2025 and is streaming on Netflix. Its rotoscope technique and philosophical approach to sports storytelling offer fresh perspectives on both animation and athletic competition.
