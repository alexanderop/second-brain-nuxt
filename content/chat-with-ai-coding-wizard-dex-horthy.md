Matt Pocock hosts Dex Horthy, founder of HumanLayer and self-described "AI coding wizard," for a live conversation about working effectively with AI coding tools.

## Context

Dex Horthy leads HumanLayer (YC F24), a company focused on helping developers build safe, impactful AI agents for complex codebases. His background includes engineering at NASA JPL and Replicated.

*Note: Transcript unavailable for this video.*

## Key Topics

Based on Dex's body of work, likely discussion areas include:

- **Context engineering** — Optimizing the input to LLMs rather than hoping for better outputs
- **Intentional compaction** — Proactively compressing context to stay in the "smart zone"
- **Research-Plan-Implement workflow** — Structured approach to complex coding tasks
- **Human-in-the-loop patterns** — When and how to involve humans in AI agent workflows
- **Production-grade agents** — Moving from demos to reliable systems
