## Core Framework

The book structures management into four progressive areas:

1. **Caring for your team** - Building trust, psychological safety, and understanding individual values
2. **Promoting collaboration** - Communication, meetings, conflict resolution, cross-team work
3. **Aiding team performance** - Prioritization, scoping work, execution speed
4. **Personal boundaries** - Sustainable leadership and self-belief

## Key Concepts

- **1:1s are critical**: Regular one-on-ones form the foundation of trust and feedback loops
- **Career laddering**: Clear growth paths help retain and develop engineers
- **Change management**: Leading teams through transitions requires deliberate communication
- **Scope down PRs**: Smaller, focused changes enable faster iteration and review
- **Trust and vulnerability**: Managers who show vulnerability build stronger teams

## Connections

Complements [[extreme-ownership-jocko-willink-tedx]] on accountability, though Drasner emphasizes empathy over command. Aligns with [[start-with-why-simon-sinek]] on team motivation through shared purpose.
