summary: "Reasoning models have made LLM-generated code undeniably good, and 2026 will bring both a major security incident from coding agents and the resolution of the sandboxing problem."

## Summary

Simon Willison shares predictions across three time horizons on the Oxide and Friends podcast. His core argument: reinforcement learning has transformed code generation to the point where his own hand-coding has dropped to single digits. The near-term brings both opportunity (sandboxing solutions, browser development via AI) and risk (a significant cybersecurity incident from coding agents).

## Key Predictions

### One Year (2026)

- **LLM code quality becomes undeniable** - Reasoning models trained with reinforcement learning have dramatically improved code generation. The debate over whether LLMs write good code will end.
- **Sandboxing finally gets solved** - Containers and WebAssembly will enable safer execution of third-party code. The missing piece is better UX.
- **A major security incident from coding agents** - References the "Normalization of Deviance" pattern: unsafe practices continue until catastrophic failure. Expect a significant breach.
- **Kakapo breeding success** - A fun non-tech prediction: New Zealand's endangered parrot will have an outstanding breeding season due to rimu fruit availability.

### Three Years

- **Jevons Paradox resolution** - The software industry will learn whether AI automation devalues engineering work or increases demand proportionally.
- **AI-built web browser** - A new browser built primarily with AI-assisted coding will ship without controversy. Existing conformance tests provide clear success metrics.

### Six Years

- **End of manual coding as paid work** - Paid code-typing positions become obsolete, though software engineering careers evolve rather than disappear.

## Takeaways

Willison frames this moment as pivotal uncertainty. The technology has clearly crossed a capability threshold, but the consequences remain unclear. Will increased productivity expand the software market (Jevons Paradox) or contract it? The security incident prediction stands out as the most concrete near-term concern - we're running untrusted code with inadequate sandboxing, and that bill will come due.
