summary: "BMAD's spec-driven methodology beats pure prompting for production-ready AI development because it forces clarity before code and catches requirements gaps before they become technical debt."

## Key Takeaways

- **Vibe coding hits a wall fast.** Anyone can produce a shiny prototype with prompts, but scaling to even 500 users exposes the fragility. Spec-driven development bridges that gap.

- **BMAD prioritizes specifications over prompts.** The framework separates intent from implementation, making success more likely than crafting a "perfect prompt" that encapsulates all context.

- **Tech debt transforms into spec debt.** Agentic coding makes refactoring easier, so poorly defined requirements—not messy code—become the real liability.

- **Recovery follows the methodology.** When requirements drift, inject new backlog items rather than bailing to vibe coding. The structured approach keeps output steerable.

- **The future remains uncertain.** Cursor's plan mode hints at spec-compatible workflows, but tools evolve fast. Spec-driven development works today; tomorrow's approach may look different.

## Notable Quotes

> "The idea of having gone from seeing outputs in 20 minutes to an hour to seeing outputs at the end of a 6-hour documentation session will be inherently frustrating."

> "Any startup that isn't leveraging this build methodology is going to find it very hard to compete."
