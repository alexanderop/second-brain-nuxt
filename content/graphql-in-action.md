## Core Framework

The book follows a three-part structure: exploring GraphQL concepts, building GraphQL APIs, and consuming them from clients. It emphasizes practical, example-driven learning with real database integrations.

## Key Concepts

- **Schema-first design**: Define your API contract with GraphQL's type system before implementing resolvers
- **Resolver optimization**: Use data batching and caching to avoid N+1 query problems
- **Fragments for components**: Design GraphQL fragments that match UI component data requirements
- **Flexible consumption**: Work with GraphQL APIs using raw fetch calls or dedicated client libraries like Apollo

## Practical Applications

The book covers both relational and document database patterns, showing how to map GraphQL schemas to real data sources. It includes mutation design patterns and subscription implementation for real-time features.
