## Key Trends

**Reasoning Models Dominated** - Started with OpenAI's o3/o3-mini/o4-mini and spread across the industry. Excel at breaking down complex problems through intermediate steps.

**Agents Became Real** - After years of hype, LLM agents finally delivered practical value, especially in coding and search applications.

**Claude Code as Game-Changer** - Released quietly in February, emerged as the year's most impactful development. Async versions enabled background task completion.

**Chinese Labs Rising** - DeepSeek's Christmas 2024 release triggered market corrections. Qwen, Moonshot AI, Z.ai, and GLM-4.7 dominated open-weight benchmarks with OSI-approved licenses.

## Notable Developments

- **$200/month subscriptions** justified by token-intensive agent usage
- **Image editing revolution** generated 100M ChatGPT signups in one week
- **Academic victories** - gold-medal IMO and ICPC performances
- **Browser integration** raised prompt injection security concerns
- **MCP adoption then pivot** - bash access proved superior for coding agents
- **Local model progress** - GPT-4-class on consumer hardware

## Warnings

**Normalization of Deviance** - Repeated YOLO-mode agent successes create dangerous risk acceptance, mirroring Challenger disaster patterns.

**The Lethal Trifecta** - Prompt injection combining data access, external communication, and untrusted content exposure.
