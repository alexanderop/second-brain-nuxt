summary: Jake Nations argues that Rich Hickey's software design principles are critical in the AI era—structured thinking beats conversational "vibe coding" with AI assistants.
notes: The simple vs easy distinction applies perfectly to AI-assisted development.

## Core Argument

AI amplifies existing approaches. Disciplined upfront thinking produces maintainable systems, while conversational "vibe coding" creates unnecessarily complex results.

## Key Concepts

### Simple vs. Easy
Rich Hickey's distinction: simplicity means non-intertwined concepts, while ease means familiarity. AI assistants make it tempting to skip the hard design work because the interface feels easy.

### Hammock-Driven Development
Deep thinking about problems prevents costly bugs. Wallas's four creative stages—preparation, incubation, illumination, verification—yield better solutions than rushing to code.

### Context Engineering
Manage AI context deliberately rather than relying on extended conversations, which accumulate complexity without intentional structure.

## Three-Phase Methodology

1. **Research** - Understand the problem deeply
2. **Planning** - Design the solution before coding
3. **Implementation** - Execute the plan

## Connections

The emphasis on deliberate thinking before action aligns with [[deep-work]]—both argue against shallow, reactive work patterns in favor of focused, intentional effort.
