I'm Alex, a developer from Germany passionate about technology and knowledge sharing.

This Second Brain is my personal knowledge base where I capture and connect ideas from books, podcasts, articles, and other content I consume. It's built on the Zettelkasten method, using wiki-links to create connections between concepts.

I write about Vue, TypeScript, AI tooling, and testing strategies on my blog. This knowledge base serves as the foundation for that content - a place to internalize concepts before sharing them.

Feel free to explore and discover connections in the knowledge graph.
