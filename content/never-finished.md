## Core Philosophy

Goggins rejects the idea of a finish line. Success isn't a destination—it's a war that demands constant vigilance. The moment you stop pushing, entropy wins. Your past achievements mean nothing if you coast on them.

## Key Concepts

- **The War Within** — The real battle happens in your own mind. External obstacles pale compared to the internal voice urging you to quit.
- **Stay Hard** — Comfort is the enemy of growth. Keep the pressure on yourself even when circumstances don't demand it.
- **No Arrival Fallacy** — There is no final "making it." Every summit reveals another peak. Embrace the climb as the point.
- **Savage Mentality** — Channel frustration and doubt into fuel. Your critics and setbacks become the raw material for motivation.

## Connections

Direct sequel to [[cant-hurt-me]], expanding on the mental toughness framework Goggins established there. While the first book focused on building the foundation, this one addresses maintaining intensity after initial success.
