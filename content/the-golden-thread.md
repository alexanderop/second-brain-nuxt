summary: "Effort has intrinsic value—AI should amplify human agency, not replace it. Shortcuts that bypass genuine work produce hollow achievements and sacrifice skill development."

## Summary

Daniel Roe draws parallels between classic fables and modern AI usage. The central argument: difficulty builds confidence and capability. Those who experience early effortless success often become failure-averse later. When AI promises "something for nothing," it echoes the same pattern as any grift—immediate output at the cost of genuine skill development.

## Key Points

- **The Effort Paradox**: Struggle strengthens us. People who bypass challenges lose the opportunity to build resilience and genuine competence.

- **Grift vs. Value**: Most grifts promise gain without contribution. AI hype contains similar messaging—suggesting developers can achieve meaningful results without meaningful effort.

- **The Value Equation**: "The value we receive is always a function of the value we contribute." Bypassing effort may produce outputs but sacrifices ownership and understanding.

- **Healthier Integration**: AI should function as a force multiplier that augments existing skills, not a replacement for human agency.

- [[heres-how-i-use-llms-to-help-me-write-code]] - Simon Willison's practical approach embodies Roe's philosophy: AI as "over-confident pair programming assistant" requiring human judgment, not autonomous replacement
- [[ai-codes-better-than-me-now-what]] - Lee Robinson's "Learn deliberately" recommendation aligns with Roe's warning against letting AI trick us into false competence
