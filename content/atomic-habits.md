The core premise: small, incremental improvements (1% better each day) compound into massive changes over time. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement.

## The Four Laws of Behavior Change

A framework for building good habits and breaking bad ones:

| To Build a Good Habit | To Break a Bad Habit |
|----------------------|---------------------|
| 1. Make it obvious | Make it invisible |
| 2. Make it attractive | Make it unattractive |
| 3. Make it easy | Make it difficult |
| 4. Make it satisfying | Make it unsatisfying |

## Key Concepts

- **Identity-based habits** — Focus on who you wish to become, not what you want to achieve. Every action is a vote for the type of person you want to be.
- **Habit stacking** — Link new habits to existing ones: "After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT]."
- **Environment design** — Make cues for good habits obvious and cues for bad habits invisible.
- **The Two-Minute Rule** — Scale any habit down to a two-minute version to make starting easy.
- **Temptation bundling** — Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.

## Connections

The science behind habit formation connects to [[science-of-setting-achieving-goals]] — both emphasize how dopamine drives motivation and how small consistent actions create lasting change.
