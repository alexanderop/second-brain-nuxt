## Core Framework

The core framework is about making small changes that compound over time.

## The Four Laws

The four laws of behavior change:

1. Make it obvious
2. Make it attractive
3. Make it easy
4. Make it satisfying

## Connections

This connects well to [[compound-effect]] thinking and the ideas in [[building-a-second-brain]] about systems.
