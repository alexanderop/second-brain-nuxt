## Summary

A technical specification document outlines how to address a technical problem through solution design and implementation. Writing specs forces engineers to examine problems before coding, creates documentation, and prevents repeatedly explaining designs to teammates. Teams benefit through efficient design communication and faster onboarding.

## Key Points

- Specs accelerate progress by aligning teams on deliverables and managing complexity
- They prevent scope creep by setting priorities so the most impactful parts ship first
- The process surfaces design flaws early, when they're cheapest to fix

## Eight Essential Components

1. **Front Matter** - Title, author, team, reviewers, dates, and references
2. **Introduction** - Problem overview, glossary, context, goals, assumptions
3. **Solutions** - Current and proposed designs, data models, business logic, deployment plans, testing strategies
4. **Further Considerations** - Security, privacy, operational, regional, and accessibility factors
5. **Success Evaluation** - Impact metrics and measurement tools
6. **Work** - Task estimates, prioritization, milestones
7. **Deliberation** - Unresolved disagreements and open questions
8. **End Matter** - Related work, references, acknowledgments

## Post-Writing Process

After drafting, review the spec independently, then circulate to team and stakeholders. Address feedback promptly, schedule discussion meetings for disagreements, and update the document throughout implementation.
