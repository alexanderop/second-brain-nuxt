summary: "Adding icons to every menu item defeats their purpose—differentiation requires scarcity, and when everything has an icon, nothing stands out."

## Summary

Prokopov critiques Apple's decision to add icons to every menu item in macOS Tahoe. The core argument: icons exist to differentiate, and adding them universally eliminates that benefit. He backs this up with the 1992 Macintosh Human Interface Guidelines, which state icons should "identify dissimilar concepts."

## Key Points

- **Differentiation requires scarcity**: When every menu item has an icon, none stand out. The visual marker loses its purpose.
- **Inconsistency undermines recognition**: Different icons represent identical operations across apps (multiple "New" variants), while identical icons mean different things.
- **Size kills detail**: Icons render at 12×12 pixels. Apple uses vector fonts instead of pixel-perfect bitmaps, resulting in blurry, illegible details.
- **Weak metaphors confuse rather than clarify**: Many icons use imagery that doesn't help users understand the action—violating HIG principles about metaphor clarity.
- **Scale makes perfection impossible**: There aren't enough good metaphors for every conceivable action. The ambition was flawed from the start.
