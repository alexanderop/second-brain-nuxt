## Key Takeaways

[[steph-ango]] (CEO of Obsidian) built his note-taking system around **speed and laziness**—reducing friction so you actually take notes instead of organizing them.

### File Over App

Notes are plain markdown files that outlast any software. If Obsidian disappears tomorrow, your notes remain readable. This philosophy shapes every design decision.

### Flat Structure with Properties

Most notes live in the vault root—no nested folders. Instead of deciding *where* a note belongs, add **categories as properties**. A single note can belong to multiple categories without duplication.

The only folders Steph keeps:
- **References** — things outside your world (people, movies, books)
- **Attachments** — images and files
- **Templates** — starting points for new notes
- **Daily** — daily notes as link anchors

### Heavy Linking

Link the **first mention** of anything—people, places, ideas, even if the target note doesn't exist yet. Over time, these connections reveal thinking patterns and create navigation paths through backlinks.

### Templates for Speed

Almost every note starts from a template. Templates auto-add relevant properties (date, categories, tags) so you capture metadata without thinking about it.

### Quick Switcher Navigation

Never browse the file tree. Press `Cmd+O` (or `Ctrl+O`) to jump directly to any note or category. The file explorer becomes irrelevant.

### Evergreen Notes

Objectify reusable ideas as **evergreen notes**—atomic insights you reference across many contexts. These turn fleeting thoughts into building blocks.

### Rating System

A 1-7 scale marks importance:
- **7** — Life-changing
- **4** — Worth remembering
- **1** — Negatively impactful

Apply ratings to anything: books, movies, meetings, experiences.

### Composable Templates

Templates don't overlap—they stack. A person who's also an author gets both the `people` and `author` templates applied, showing meetings *and* books they've written.

## The Daily Rhythm

1. **Daily**: Create unique notes for thoughts as they occur, linking first mentions
2. **Every few days**: Review recent notes, compile patterns into new insights
3. **Occasionally**: Resurface highly-rated items for deeper engagement

## Notable Quotes

> "His system is oriented towards speed and laziness—he doesn't want the overhead of deciding where things should go."

> "Even if these new things aren't pointing to anything yet... this heavy linking style becomes more useful as time goes on."
