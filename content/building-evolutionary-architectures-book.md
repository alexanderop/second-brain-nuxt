Software systems must adapt to constant change—new tools, frameworks, techniques, and paradigms emerge continuously. This book presents evolutionary architecture as a way to manage architectural change while protecting the characteristics that matter most.

## Core Concept

Evolutionary architecture supports guided, incremental change across technical, organizational, and temporal dimensions. The key mechanism: fitness functions—automated assessments that verify whether architectural properties remain intact during modifications.

## The Three Pillars

**Guided change** — Fitness functions steer evolution toward desired outcomes, providing objective assessment of architecture characteristics like performance, security, and structural integrity.

**Incremental modification** — Small changes verified continuously. Software's defining characteristic is hundreds of thousands of moving parts, any of which can change at any time.

**Multiple dimensions** — Not just code, but data, security, and operational characteristics. Database schemas must evolve alongside application code.

## Why It Matters

Traditional architecture assumes stability—design upfront, build to spec. Reality proves otherwise. Requirements shift, technologies emerge, teams change. Evolutionary architecture embraces this reality by building adaptability into the system's DNA.
