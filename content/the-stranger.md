## The Absurd Hero

Meursault embodies Camus' absurdist philosophy. He refuses to lie about his feelings—he didn't cry at his mother's funeral, he doesn't pretend to love Marie, he won't fake remorse for killing a man. Society punishes this honesty more than the murder itself.

## Key Themes

- **Emotional authenticity over social performance** — Meursault's "crime" is refusing to play the roles society expects
- **The indifferent universe** — The sun, the sea, the heat matter more to Meursault than human drama
- **Meaning through acceptance** — Only facing execution does Meursault embrace life's absurdity and find peace

## The Trial as Farce

The courtroom scenes expose society's need for narrative. Prosecutors build a case around Meursault's behavior at his mother's funeral, not the shooting. They need a monster, not a man who simply didn't perform grief on cue.

## Connections

Shares thematic DNA with [[no-longer-human]]—both protagonists feel fundamentally disconnected from humanity and unable to perform the emotions society demands.
