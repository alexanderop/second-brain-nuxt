## Key Takeaways

- Mind Map Builder runs as an Excalidraw script, installable via the Obsidian Tools panel
- Navigate mind maps with Alt+Arrow keys for friction-free editing
- Copy/paste between mind maps and markdown bullet lists enables rapid workflows

## Features

### Keyboard Shortcuts

The script provides several Enter key variations:

- **Ctrl+Enter**: Create child node and keep focus on input
- **Shift+Enter**: Create child node and close the panel
- **Ctrl+Shift+Enter**: Pin/unpin a node's position

Pinned nodes retain their location during auto-layout, letting you control which branches stay on specific sides.

### Growth Modes

Three layout strategies available:

1. **Right-facing**: All branches extend rightward
2. **Left-facing**: All branches extend leftward
3. **Radial**: Branches spread in all directions

Unpinned nodes rearrange automatically when switching modes.

### Visual Customization

- Multi-color branches (random colors per branch) or uniform colors
- Font sizes on Fibonacci scale, uniform, or standard Excalidraw scale
- Optional rounded boxes around nodes
- Configurable text wrapping width and alignment

### Markdown Interoperability

Select a mind map and click "Copy" to export as bullet-point markdown. Paste markdown bullet lists back into Mind Map Builder to generate visual maps instantly.

## Other Features Covered

The video also demonstrates two additional Excalidraw 2.18 features:

- **LaTeX support**: Insert and edit mathematical formulas with live preview
- **Smart arrows**: Arrows that point to specific locations on images and stay connected as elements move
