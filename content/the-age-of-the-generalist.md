summary: "AI accelerates routine tasks but lacks architectural judgment—the future belongs to high-agency generalists who identify problems and drive solutions without waiting for direction."

## Core Argument

The shift toward generalism preceded AI but accelerates with it. Teams already hire full-stack developers instead of splitting frontend and backend roles. Startups require developers who wear multiple hats. AI amplifies this trend by commoditizing specialist tasks like boilerplate generation and scaffolding.

## The High Agency Factor

AI replaces passive workers, not proactive builders. The key differentiator becomes "high agency"—self-direction, initiative, and problem-solving without explicit instruction. Specialists who wait for tickets will struggle. Generalists who identify what matters and act on it will thrive.

## The Leonardo Model

Renaissance polymaths like da Vinci embody the ideal: curious across disciplines, self-directed in learning, hands-on in creation. This mindset—broad exploration combined with active building—defines success in the AI era.

## Key Insight

AI lacks architectural judgment. It cannot distinguish good patterns from poor ones. The value shifts from writing code to knowing what code to write and why.
