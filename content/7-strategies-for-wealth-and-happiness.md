## The 7 Strategies

1. **Unleash the Power of Goals** — Set concrete objectives across all life domains. Write them down.

2. **Seek Knowledge** — Learn continuously through reading, reflection, and mentorship. Self-education builds fortunes.

3. **Learn How to Change** — Personal transformation precedes external success. Work on yourself first.

4. **Control Your Finances** — Follow the 70/30 rule: live on 70%, allocate 30% to savings, investment, and giving.

5. **Master Time** — Schedule strategically. What you do with your hours determines your results.

6. **Surround Yourself with Winners** — Your associations shape your outcomes. Choose relationships that elevate you.

7. **Learn the Art of Living Well** — Wealth means little without happiness. Develop practices that amplify joy.

## Core Philosophy

Rohn argues that income rarely exceeds personal development. The path to prosperity runs through self-improvement, not circumstance. Discipline bridges the gap between intention and achievement.

## Key Insight

Formal education provides a living. Self-education builds a fortune. The difference between where you are and where you want to be comes down to daily disciplines applied consistently.
