tweetText: "This has been said a thousand times before, but allow me to add my own voice: the era of humans writing code is over. Disturbing for those of us who identify as SWEs, but no less true. That's not to say SWEs don't have work to do, but writing syntax directly is not it."

Ryan Dahl (creator of Node.js and Deno) shares his perspective on the future of software engineering in the age of AI. The shift is from writing code to reviewing and validating AI-generated code.

Notable replies highlight the nuance:
- Steve Krouse: The role of the human brain in programming is evolving, similar to the shift from punchcards
- The skill set changes to reviewing, catching edge cases, and knowing what to ask for - "still deeply technical"
- Code review becomes more important than code writing
