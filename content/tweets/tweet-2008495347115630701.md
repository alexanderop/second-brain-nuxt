  a practical guide to context engineering

  "ai slop" is no longer the fault of the model, but the fault of the user.

  in black box systems like claude code, context is the single input we can control - so how do we optimize it?

## Key Insights

### Context Window Management
- Claude Code has 200k tokens, but only ~120k usable after system prompts and reserved space
- Performance degrades as context grows, even below the limit
- Goal: "find the smallest possible set of high-signal tokens"

### The 80/20 Basics
1. `/upgrade` → max plan
2. `/model` → opus 4.5
3. `/init` → create CLAUDE.md for project context

### Workflow
- Start in plan mode (shift + tab)
- Ask Claude to clarify ambiguity with questions
- Keep conversations focused on single objectives
- Use `/compact` when approaching limits, or `/rewind` / `/new` when stuck

### MCP Servers (Just-in-Time Context)
Recommended servers:
- **exa.ai** → web search
- **context7** → up-to-date docs
- **grep.app** → GitHub search

### Subagents for Context Efficiency
- Spawn subagents with separate context windows
- Use cheaper models (Sonnet) for research tasks
- Return condensed summaries to main agent
- Example: "librarian" subagent for documentation research

### Skills
- Pull specialized prompts into context when needed
- Example: "frontend designer" skill for UI work

## Takeaway

Good vibe coding is about optimizing for value-dense context. Don't over-complicate with fancy setups - master the basics first.
