A practical workflow for building large features with Claude Code:

1. Start with minimal spec/prompt
2. Have Claude interview you via `AskUserQuestionTool` to flesh out requirements
3. New session to execute the refined spec

This separates the **discovery/planning phase** from **execution**, avoiding context pollution and giving Claude a clear, complete spec to work from.
