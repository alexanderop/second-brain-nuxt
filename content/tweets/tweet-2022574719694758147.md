tweetText: "everyone's talking about their teams like they were at the peak of efficiency and bottlenecked by ability to produce code\n\nhere's what things actually look like\n\n- your org rarely has good ideas. ideas being expensive to implement was actually helping\n\n- majority of workers have no reason to be super motivated, they want to do their 9-5 and get back to their life\n\n- they're not using AI to be 10x more effective they're using it to churn out their tasks with less energy spend\n\n- the 2 people on your team that actually tried are now flattened by the slop code everyone is producing, they will quit soon\n\n- even when you produce work faster you're still bottlenecked by bureaucracy and the dozen other realities of shipping something real\n\n- your CFO is like what do you mean each engineer now costs $2000 extra per month in LLM bills"
