  here's the opencode session i used to create a detailed plan for a workspaces feature in alkalye.com.

  i first described what was on my mind and then had it interview me for details.

  then i gave it matts post to generate a bash script and a prd file based on the plan.

  let it run over night

  and now have this PR to review with 60 commits and 5k new lines of code

Great example of [[ralph-wiggum-technique]] in action - interview-driven planning followed by overnight autonomous execution.
