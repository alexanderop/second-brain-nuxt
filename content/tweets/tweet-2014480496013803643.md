tweetText: "We're turning Todos into Tasks in Claude Code. Today, we're upgrading Todos in Claude Code to Tasks. Tasks are a new primitive that help Claude Code track and complete more complicated projects and collaborate on them across multiple sessions or subagents."

Key points from the article:

- **Tasks replace Todos** - As Opus 4.5 can run autonomously longer and track state better, TodoWrite became unnecessary for smaller tasks
- **Cross-session collaboration** - Tasks are stored in `~/.claude/tasks` filesystem, allowing multiple subagents or sessions to collaborate
- **Dependencies & blockers** - Tasks can have dependencies on each other stored in metadata, mirroring real project workflows
- **Broadcast updates** - When one session updates a Task, it broadcasts to all sessions working on the same Task List
- **Environment variable control** - Set `CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID` to make sessions collaborate on a single Task List:
  ```bash
  CLAUDE_CODE_TASK_LIST_ID=groceries claude
  ```
- **Works with SDK** - Also works for `claude -p` and the AgentSDK
