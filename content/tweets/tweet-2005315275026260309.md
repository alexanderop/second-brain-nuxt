Thread highlights:
- For big features, Claude might ask 40+ questions resulting in a much more detailed spec
- Prompt used: "read this @SPEC.md and interview me in detail using the AskUserQuestionTool about literally anything: technical implementation, UI & UX, concerns, tradeoffs, etc. but make sure the questions are not obvious. be very in-depth and continue"
