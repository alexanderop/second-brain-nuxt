Comprehensive thread on Claude Code configuration by someone who's used it daily for 10 months and won a hackathon with it.

## Skills and Commands

Skills operate like rules, scoped to workflows. They're shorthand prompts for specific workflows:
- `/refactor-clean` - Clean dead code and loose files after long sessions
- `/tdd`, `/e2e`, `/test-coverage` - Testing workflows
- Commands can be chained together

**Storage locations:**
- Skills: `~/.claude/skills/` - broader workflow definitions
- Commands: `~/.claude/commands/` - quick executable prompts

## Hooks

Trigger-based automations that fire on specific events:
- **PreToolUse** - Before a tool executes (validation, reminders)
- **PostToolUse** - After a tool finishes (formatting, feedback loops)
- **UserPromptSubmit** - When you send a message
- **Stop** - When Claude finishes responding
- **PreCompact** - Before context compaction
- **Notification** - Permission requests

Example use cases:
- tmux reminder before long-running commands
- Auto-format with Prettier after edits
- TypeScript check after `.ts/.tsx` edits
- Block unnecessary `.md` file creation

Pro tip: Use the `hookify` plugin to create hooks conversationally.

## Subagents

Processes the main Claude can delegate tasks to with limited scopes. Can run in background or foreground, freeing up context.

Example structure:
- `planner.md` - Feature implementation planning
- `architect.md` - System design decisions
- `tdd-guide.md` - Test-driven development
- `code-reviewer.md` - Quality/security review
- `security-reviewer.md` - Vulnerability analysis

Configure allowed tools, MCPs, and permissions per subagent for proper scoping.

## Rules and Memory

Two approaches:
1. Single `CLAUDE.md` - Everything in one file
2. Rules folder - Modular `.md` files grouped by concern (`security.md`, `coding-style.md`, `testing.md`, etc.)

## MCPs (Model Context Protocol)

Connect Claude to external services directly. Not a replacement for APIs - it's a prompt-driven wrapper around them.

Examples:
- Supabase MCP - Pull data, run SQL directly
- Chrome in Claude - Built-in plugin for autonomous browser control

## Context Window Management (Critical)

> Your 200k context window before compacting might only be 70k with too many tools enabled.

**Rule of thumb:** Have 20-30 MCPs in config, but keep under 10 enabled / under 80 tools active.

## Plugins

Package tools for easy installation. Can be skill + MCP combined, or hooks/tools bundled.

LSP Plugins are particularly useful outside editors - gives real-time type checking, go-to-definition without an IDE.

## Key Tips

**Keyboard shortcuts:**
- `Ctrl+U` - Delete entire line
- `!` - Quick bash prefix
- `@` - Search files
- `/` - Slash commands
- `Shift+Enter` - Multi-line input
- `Tab` - Toggle thinking
- `Esc Esc` - Interrupt / restore

**Parallel workflows:**
- `/fork` - Fork conversations for non-overlapping parallel tasks
- Git worktrees - Independent checkouts for parallel Claudes
- tmux - Session persistence for long-running commands

**Other commands:**
- `/rewind` - Go back to previous state
- `/statusline` - Customize with branch, context %, todos
- `/checkpoints` - File-level undo points
- `/compact` - Manual context compaction

## His Actual Setup

**Plugins (4-5 enabled at a time):**
- typescript-lsp, pyright-lsp (LSP intelligence)
- hookify (hook creation)
- mgrep (better search than ripgrep)
- context7 (live documentation)

**Key insight:** Has 14 MCPs configured but only 5-6 enabled per project. Keeps context window healthy.

**Hooks examples:**
- PreToolUse: tmux reminder, block `.md` creation, review before push
- PostToolUse: Prettier auto-format, tsc check, console.log warnings
- Stop: Audit for console.logs before session ends
