  I'm Boris and I created Claude Code. Lots of people have asked how I use Claude Code, so I wanted to show off my setup a bit.

  My setup might be surprisingly vanilla! Claude Code works great out of the box, so I personally don't customize it much. There is no one correct way to use Claude Code: we intentionally build it in a way that you can use it, customize it, and hack it however you like. Each person on the Claude Code team uses it very differently.

  So, here goes.

Thread highlights:
- Runs 5 Claudes in parallel in terminal (tabs 1-5) with system notifications
- Also runs 5-10 Claudes on claude.ai/code in parallel, using --teleport to switch between local and web
- Uses Opus 4.5 with thinking for everything - slower but requires less steering
- Team shares a single CLAUDE.md checked into git, updated multiple times a week
- Uses @.claude in PR reviews to update CLAUDE.md via GitHub Action
