  The disappearing middle of software work

  I think the center of software work is moving.

  The middle of software work has been the most important part for a long time. You started with an idea, and eventually you shipped something, but almost all of the effort lived in between. Turning intent into something real meant opening the codebase, booting up the environment, and writing the code. That middle absorbed most of the time, attention, and craft of software teams.

  My belief is that this is changing.

  Pure coding agent workflows can now produce working code from goals, context, and tasks. They operate more independently, requiring you to touch the code less and rely on the IDE less. The IDE becomes more of a code viewer than a writing tool.

  As these systems improve, this middle becomes thinner. Less time is spent manually translating intent into implementation.

  What actually needs to be built is still the important question. Understanding the problem, gathering the right context from customers and internal teams, and shaping the work so it can be acted on effectively matters more because agents act directly on that input.

  Design, in this sense, is not about artifacts or tools. It is about forming and shaping clarity of the intent through ideas, exploration, research, and discussion. It is about deciding what matters, what constraints apply, and what tradeoffs are acceptable. Good product work is seeking clarity. What would make this execution actually matter.

  In this era, directing and managing agent work becomes the craft. Writing code is less like constructing a solution and more like setting up the conditions for a good solution to emerge. This might not be even an individual task, but an organizational one: how can you create these conditions as to the whole product team.

  This is what we work on. The Linear workspace is the coordination and context layer for product work. It captures intent, needs, constraints, and ownership in a way that makes work understandable before, during and after execution. There is still a lot for us to do here, but we are starting to see how effective AI and agents can be in a context-rich environments that connect directly customer feedback, the tools an have structured entities, workflows, that have intended outcomes. A bug reported on an iOS app in triage, has very clear expected outcome, it should be debugged and fixed.

  Structure in tools works for humans and agents the same way, it reduces the ambiguity what is expected or what capabilities exists.

  Additionally happens when the middle starts producing large amounts of output with less direct supervision, is more pressure on the end of the work: reviewing, testing, and releasing code. The tooling or workflows need to improve and change to handle it, and potentially also blend in to the overall process, not be a stopgap at the very end.

  When the middle disappears or blends in, what becomes more in focus is the work of forming the right intent and making sure the outcome actually meets it.
