## Key Arguments

### AI Funding Boom: Replit & Parloa (30:00)

Replit raises $400M at $9B valuation for vibe-coding tools—roughly 5% dilution showing capital-efficient growth. At estimated $200-250M revenue, that's 35-40x multiples.

Parloa, a German customer service AI company, triples its valuation to $3B in just 8 months with a $350M round. At $50M ARR, that's 60x ARR—sportlich, but the hosts argue AI customer service is one of the few areas where AI demonstrably outperforms humans: faster, more available, often friendlier. With every customer and conversation, the model improves through reinforcement learning.

### Aleph Alpha's Downfall (19:30)

Founder Jonas Andrulis exits Aleph Alpha with thinly veiled frustration: "This was not the outcome I anticipated when we began this journey together." Up to 15% of staff are being cut.

The hosts suggest winding down entirely might be smarter than pivoting. The brand is "tainted"—associated with failure rather than innovation. Better to integrate useful personnel into Schwarz IT and start fresh than drag out negative press.

### DeepSeek's Hedge Fund Origins (34:30)

The hedge fund behind DeepSeek posted 57% returns—a stellar result for any fund, exceptional during this market. With $10B under management, that's roughly $5.5B in gains, $1-2B going to the founder personally.

The hosts speculate: did they short Nvidia during the DeepSeek announcement crash? If you control when AI chip stocks drop 15%, you'd produce extraordinary returns too. Film-worthy story, though the true motivations remain opaque.

### Tesla FSD Subscription Pivot (37:00)

Tesla eliminates the $8,000 one-time FSD purchase after Valentine's Day, leaving only the $99/month subscription. Three possible explanations:

1. **Revenue push**: Create urgency for high-margin Q1 revenue
2. **Subscription multiple**: Recurring revenue commands higher market valuations
3. **Musk's bonus targets**: He needs to hit subscription milestones for his compensation package
4. **Product reality**: The one-time purchase wasn't selling—customers realized they could subscribe monthly and cancel

Mathematically, at current rates, you'd only break even after 7+ years. The subscription is the smarter consumer choice.

### Copilot Hallucination Causes Real-World Harm (43:15)

UK police used Microsoft Copilot for an intelligence report. Copilot invented a fictional football match between West Ham and Maccabi Tel Aviv, then placed Israeli fans on a no-fly list based on fabricated incidents. Clear proof that AI in critical systems still requires human verification—especially problematic when used by law enforcement.

### Translation Wars: ChatGPT vs Google (42:00)

ChatGPT launches a standalone Translate product supporting 50 languages. Google counters with Translate Gemma—open-source models at 4B, 12B, and 27B parameters, with the smaller model optimized for on-device use.

Google's strategy: if OpenAI tries to monetize translation, make it free for everyone. DeepL faces pressure from both directions.

## Predictions Made

- **Paloa could reach $10B** if AI customer service improvement continues compounding (Confidence: medium)
- **Aleph Alpha name is finished** — the brand carries too much negative association (Confidence: high)
- **CNBC Germany launch** signals growing German retail investor base, driven by Trade Republic and Scalable success (Confidence: high)
