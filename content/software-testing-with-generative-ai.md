## Core Ideas

Mark Winteringham cuts through the AI hype to show where generative AI actually helps testers. The book focuses on three practical applications: generating synthetic test data, augmenting test design, and supporting automation efforts.

## Key Takeaways

- AI works best as a collaborator, not a replacement for testing expertise
- Synthetic data generation solves real problems around privacy and edge cases
- Prompt engineering matters: better prompts yield better test suggestions
- AI can accelerate exploratory testing by suggesting scenarios humans might miss
