I'm trying to quit Instagram. It's hard. Really hard.

Of all the social media apps, Instagram is the one that has its hooks in me deepest. Those reels—they just keep coming. One after another, each one a tiny hit of novelty. And over the past few years, something has changed in me that I can't ignore anymore.

I can't watch a movie without looking at my phone.

## Movies Mean Something to Me

When I was young, my father would rent movies and we'd watch them together as a family. There was no smartphone, nothing to distract us—we were all sharing the same experience, together in that room, absorbed in the same story.

Movies are one of my favorite things in the world. Or at least they used to be.

Now? I start a movie and pause it. Check my phone. Do something else. Come back. Pause again. The idea of sitting still for 90 minutes feels almost impossible. And this terrifies me more than any productivity metric ever could.

## The Test

Here's a simple experiment: Put on a movie you genuinely want to watch. Place your phone in another room. See if you can make it through without reaching for it.

I failed.

That was my wake-up call.

## We're Entertaining Ourselves to Death

This isn't just about movies. It's about what we've done to our brains.

Dr. Anna Lembke, a psychiatrist who studies addiction, describes our situation perfectly[^1]: our brains evolved for scarcity, but we now live in a world of endless abundance. Every swipe delivers a tiny dopamine hit, and our brains adapt by downregulating—we need more stimulation just to feel normal. The relentless pursuit of pleasure leads to anhedonia, the inability to take joy in anything at all.

This is why I can't watch a movie anymore. My brain has been trained to expect novelty every fifteen seconds. A slow pan across a landscape? A character building to an emotional moment? My brain screams for something faster, something new.

Cal Newport makes a related point[^2]: if every moment of boredom is relieved with a smartphone glance, your brain isn't ready for deep work. The constant switching from low-stimuli activities to high-stimuli ones teaches your brain to never tolerate the absence of novelty.

## Nobody Is Ever Bored Anymore

Our brains hate boredom. But with Instagram, nobody is ever bored. And that's the problem.

Boredom is useful. When you're bored, you get creative. You reach out to friends. You do something to escape it. This is why when I was young, I was always hanging around with my friends—playing video games together, kicking a football around, just being present with people.

Some people say: "You can spend time with your friends and still be on Instagram." Sure. But if you think that, you don't understand how addiction works. You don't understand dopamine. When you're sitting with a friend but scrolling through reels, you're not really there. You're somewhere else, chasing a hit that makes actual human connection feel boring by comparison.

I genuinely believe social media has been a net negative for society. Without it, I would spend much more time with the people I care about.

## The Fix Isn't Willpower

Here's what I've learned: you can't willpower your way out of this.

James Clear explains it well[^3]: people who appear to have tremendous self-control aren't actually more disciplined. They're just better at structuring their lives so they don't need willpower in the first place. Self-control is a short-term strategy, not a long-term one.

Anna Lembke calls this "self-binding"—creating physical barriers between yourself and your drug of choice. Delete the app. Put the phone in another room. Make the bad behavior invisible.

So that's what I'm doing. I deleted Instagram. The first week was brutal. Phantom phone checking, that itch to fill every empty moment. But I'm pushing through because I want my attention back. I want to watch movies again—really watch them, the way I did when I was a kid sitting next to my father.

## Try It Yourself

This weekend, try the 90-minute test:

1. Pick a movie you've been meaning to watch
2. Put your phone in another room
3. No pausing except for the bathroom
4. See what happens

If you can do it easily, you're probably fine. But if you can't—if you feel that pull, that restlessness, that desperate need to check something, anything—that's data. What you do with that data is up to you.

I know what I'm doing with mine.

## Open Questions

- Should I include screen time stats from before/after?
- Add section on what I do with the reclaimed time?
- Mention specific movies that tested my patience vs. ones that pulled me in?
