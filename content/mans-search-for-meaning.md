## Core Framework

Frankl introduces logotherapy, the "Third Viennese School" of psychotherapy after Freud's psychoanalysis and Adler's individual psychology. The central thesis: humans are driven not by pleasure (Freud) or power (Adler) but by a will to meaning.

## Key Concepts

- **Will to meaning**: The primary motivational force in humans is finding purpose, not seeking pleasure or avoiding pain
- **Tragic optimism**: Maintaining hope while acknowledging suffering—saying yes to life despite everything
- **Attitude as freedom**: When we cannot change a situation, we can still choose our response to it
- **Existential vacuum**: Modern malaise stems from a lack of meaning, not repressed desires

## The Concentration Camp Insight

Frankl observed that prisoners who maintained a sense of purpose—a reason to survive—had better odds of enduring. Those who lost hope often died within days. Suffering becomes bearable when it serves a purpose.

## Practical Application

Logotherapy asks: "What is life asking of me?" rather than "What do I want from life?" Meaning can be found through creative work, experiencing beauty or love, or choosing one's attitude toward unavoidable suffering.
