Evergreen notes are written and organized to evolve, contribute, and accumulate over time across projects. Unlike transient notes, they're designed to develop lasting insight rather than merely capture information.

## Key Principles

1. **Atomic** — Each note covers a single concept, making it self-contained and reusable
2. **Concept-oriented** — Organize by idea rather than by source (author, book, project)
3. **Densely linked** — Create rich connections between related notes
4. **Associative over hierarchical** — Prefer emergent structure through links rather than rigid taxonomies
5. **Write for yourself** — Disregard external audience; focus on personal understanding

## Why It Matters

Better note-taking means better thinking. The practice moves beyond passive collection toward active knowledge synthesis. Notes become a thinking environment, not just storage.

## Implementation

- **Reading inbox** — Capture references for later processing
- **Writing inbox** — Hold transient thoughts until they mature
- **Progressive refinement** — Notes evolve from rough to polished over time
- **Executable strategy** — Write about what you read to internalize it deeply

## Related Concepts

The methodology draws heavily from Niklas Luhmann's **Zettelkasten** (slip-box) system and integrates ideas from spaced repetition for memory retention.
