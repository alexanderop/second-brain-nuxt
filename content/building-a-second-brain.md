## The PARA System

- **Projects** - Short-term efforts with deadlines
- **Areas** - Long-term responsibilities
- **Resources** - Topics of ongoing interest
- **Archives** - Inactive items

## Connections

Progressive summarization helps with distillation. This methodology pairs well with the habit systems from [[atomic-habits]].
