## Morning Protocol

Get bright light exposure within 30-60 minutes of waking. This sets your circadian rhythm and promotes alertness.

## Evening Protocol

Dim lights in the evening hours. Avoid bright overhead lights after sunset to support natural melatonin release.

## Temperature

Keep the sleeping environment cool. Core body temperature needs to drop for sleep onset.

## Timing

Maintain consistent sleep and wake times, even on weekends.
