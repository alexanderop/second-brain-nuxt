## Key Concepts

Deep work is professional activity performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that pushes cognitive capabilities to their limit.

## The Deep Work Hypothesis

The ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy.

## Strategies

1. Work deeply with rituals and routines
2. Embrace boredom to train focus
3. Quit social media or use it intentionally
4. Drain the shallows by scheduling every minute
