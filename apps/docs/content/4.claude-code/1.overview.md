# Claude Code Integration

Second Brain is designed to work seamlessly with [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code), an AI-powered coding assistant. The project includes 19+ custom skills that automate common knowledge management tasks.

## What Are Claude Code Skills?

Claude Code skills are specialized instructions that teach Claude how to perform specific tasks in your codebase. Each skill:

- **Defines a workflow** - Step-by-step instructions for accomplishing a task
- **Specifies allowed tools** - Which Claude Code tools (Read, Write, Bash, etc.) the skill can use
- **Provides templates** - Frontmatter examples, content structures, and output formats
- **Handles edge cases** - Error recovery, validation, and user prompts

When you invoke a skill (e.g., `/adding-notes`), Claude loads the skill's instructions and follows them to complete your request.

## Directory Structure

Skills live in the `.claude/skills/` directory:

```text
.claude/
├── skills/
│   ├── adding-notes/
│   │   ├── skill.md           # Main skill instructions
│   │   ├── scripts/           # Helper scripts (Python, Bash)
│   │   └── references/        # Content type templates
│   ├── enhancing-notes/
│   │   └── skill.md
│   ├── linking-notes/
│   │   └── skill.md
│   └── ... (19+ skills)
└── settings.json              # Claude Code configuration
```

## CLAUDE.md

The `CLAUDE.md` file in the project root provides Claude with essential context:

```markdown
# CLAUDE.md

Second Brain is a personal knowledge base for capturing and
connecting content using Zettelkasten-style wiki-links.

## Owner
This Second Brain belongs to **Alexander Opalic**.

## Commands
pnpm dev, pnpm build, pnpm lint:fix, pnpm typecheck

## Structure
- apps/web/app/ - Vue application
- apps/web/content/ - Markdown files
- apps/web/site.config.ts - Site customization
```

Claude reads this file automatically when working in the project, giving it awareness of the tech stack, commands, and conventions.

## How Skills Work

### Skill Anatomy

Each skill has a frontmatter header and markdown body:

```markdown
---
name: adding-notes
description: Add new notes to the Second Brain knowledge base.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Bash, WebFetch, Glob, Grep, Task
---

# Adding Notes to Second Brain

## Workflow Phases
Phase 1: Type Detection → Route to content-type file
Phase 2: Parallel Metadata Collection
Phase 3: Author Creation
...
```

### Invoking Skills

Use slash commands in Claude Code:

```text
/adding-notes https://youtube.com/watch?v=xyz

/enhancing-notes atomic-habits

/linking-notes my-new-note
```

Claude reads the skill file and follows its instructions step-by-step.

### Skill Phases

Most skills follow a phased workflow:

1. **Input Validation** - Check arguments and find target files
2. **Data Collection** - Fetch metadata, run scripts, search web
3. **Content Generation** - Create frontmatter, body content, wiki-links
4. **User Review** - Present preview for approval (blocking gate)
5. **Save & Validate** - Write file, run quality checks
6. **Quality Check** - `pnpm lint:fix && pnpm typecheck`

### Blocking Gates

Many skills include **blocking gates** where Claude pauses for user approval:

```yaml
question: "Does this look good?"
header: "Review"
options:
  - label: "Save"
  - label: "Regenerate"
  - label: "Edit"
  - label: "Cancel"
```

This prevents Claude from making changes without your consent.

## Creating Your Own Skills

Skills are just markdown files. To create a new skill:

1. Create a directory: `.claude/skills/your-skill-name/`
2. Add `skill.md` with frontmatter and instructions
3. Reference the skill in your requests

See [Extending the App](/customization/extending#adding-claude-code-skills) for detailed instructions on creating custom skills.

## Best Practices

### When to Use Skills

- **Adding content**: Always use `/adding-notes` for consistent frontmatter
- **Enhancing notes**: Use `/enhancing-notes` or `/enhancing-talks` for structured summaries
- **Organizing**: Use `/linking-notes` and `/moc-curator` periodically
- **Quality checks**: Run `/reviewing-notes` to find issues

### Tips for Effective Use

1. **Provide context** - Include URLs, titles, or slugs in your request
2. **Review previews** - Check generated content before saving
3. **Run quality checks** - Skills run `pnpm lint:fix && pnpm typecheck` automatically
4. **Use existing tags** - Skills suggest tags from your existing vocabulary

### Skill Composition

Skills can invoke other skills internally:

- `/adding-notes` references `/writing-style` for prose guidelines
- `/moc-curator` follows the linking philosophy from `/adding-notes`
- `/enhancing-notes` uses the writing style checklist

This ensures consistent quality across all generated content.
