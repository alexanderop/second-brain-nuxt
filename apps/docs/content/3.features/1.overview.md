# Features Overview

Second Brain is packed with features designed to help you capture, connect, and rediscover your knowledge. This section provides detailed documentation for each major feature.

## Core Features

### Content Management

The foundation of Second Brain is its flexible content system that supports multiple content types with rich metadata.

- **16 Content Types** - Books, podcasts, articles, YouTube videos, movies, TV shows, manga, tweets, courses, Reddit posts, GitHub repos, newsletters, quotes, notes, evergreens, and maps of content
- **Wiki-Linking** - Connect any note to any other using `[[slug]]` syntax
- **Rich Metadata** - Track authors, tags, ratings, reading status, and more
- **Flat Structure** - No folders, just connections. Structure emerges from links
