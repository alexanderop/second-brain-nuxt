# Table View

The Table View provides a spreadsheet-like interface for browsing and filtering your entire knowledge base.

## Overview

Access the table view at `/table`. It displays all content items in a sortable, filterable table with columns for title, type, authors, tags, consumed date, and rating.

```
/table                    # Default view (sorted by date consumed, newest first)
/table?type=book,article  # Pre-filtered by content type
/table?sort=title&dir=asc # Sorted alphabetically by title
```

## Table Columns

| Column | Description | Features |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Title** | Content title (clickable to navigate) | Sortable (A-Z, Z-A), pinned on mobile |
| **Type** | Content type with icon badge | Filterable, sortable |
| **Authors** | Author avatars and names | Filterable via searchable dropdown |
| **Tags** | Up to 3 tag badges displayed | Filterable (top 15 tags shown) |
| **Consumed** | Date content was consumed | Sortable (newest/oldest first) |
| **Rating** | Numeric rating (1-10) | Filterable by range, sortable |
| **Actions** | External link button | Opens content in new tab |

## Filtering

Filters are accessible via column header dropdowns and use OR logic within each filter type.

### Type Filter

Click the "Type" column header to:

- Sort by type (ascending/descending)
- Filter by one or more content types
- Each type shows its icon for quick identification

### Authors Filter

Click the "Authors" column header to open a searchable multi-select dropdown:

- Search authors by name
- Select multiple authors (OR logic)
- Shows author avatars for visual identification

### Tags Filter

Click the "Tags" column header to:

- Select from the top 15 most common tags
- Multiple tag selection supported
- Tags are dynamically filtered based on current results

### Rating Filter

Click the "Rating" column header to:

- Sort by rating (highest/lowest first)
- Filter by rating range using a slider (1-10)
- Click "Apply" to activate the range filter

### Active Filters Bar

When filters are active, a bar appears above the table showing:

- Colored chips for each active filter
- Click any chip to remove that specific filter
- "Clear all" button to reset all filters

Filter types use different colors:
- **Type**: Neutral color
- **Tags**: Primary color
- **Authors**: Secondary color
- **Rating range**: Warning color

## Sorting

Click any sortable column header to access sort options:

| Column | Sort Options |
|--------|--------------|
| Title | A to Z, Z to A |
| Type | Ascending, Descending |
| Consumed | Newest first, Oldest first |
| Rating | Highest first, Lowest first |

The current sort direction is indicated by an arrow icon in the column header.

## Pagination

The table displays 25 items per page with navigation controls:

- Page numbers with sibling count of 1
- Previous/Next buttons
- Shows "Showing X-Y of Z items" info
- Edge pages always visible

Changing filters automatically resets to page 1.

## URL State Synchronization

All filter and sort state is synchronized with the URL query parameters:

```
/table?type=book,article&tags=productivity&sort=rating&dir=desc&page=2
```

Parameters:
- `type` - Comma-separated content types
- `tags` - Comma-separated tag names
- `authors` - Comma-separated author slugs
- `dateConsumedFrom` / `dateConsumedTo` - Date range
- `ratingMin` / `ratingMax` - Rating range
- `sort` - Sort column (title, type, dateConsumed, rating)
- `dir` - Sort direction (asc, desc)
- `page` - Current page number

This enables:
- Shareable filtered views via URL
- Browser back/forward navigation
- Bookmarkable filter states

## User Interactions

### Row Click

Click any row to navigate to that content's detail page.

### External Link

Click the external link icon (rightmost column) to open the content in a new tab.

### Scroll Position Restoration

The table remembers your scroll position within the session. When you navigate away and return, you'll be at the same scroll position.

## Technical Implementation

The table view is built with:

- **UTable** from `@nuxt/ui` - Core table component with column pinning
- **useContentTable** composable - State management, filtering, sorting, pagination
- **useTableFilterMenus** composable - Filter dropdown menu generation
- **useRouteQuery** from VueUse - URL state synchronization
- **sessionStorage** - Scroll position persistence

### Key Files

```
app/pages/table.vue              # Page component
app/components/content/ContentTable.vue  # Table component
app/composables/useContentTable.ts       # State and logic
app/composables/useTableFilterMenus.ts   # Filter menu items
```

### Data Flow

1. Content and authors are fetched via `queryCollection()`
2. Authors are enriched into content items for display
3. Filters are applied client-side for instant feedback
4. Results are sorted and paginated
5. State changes sync to URL for shareability

## Keyboard Navigation

While the table page doesn't have specific keyboard shortcuts, you can use the global navigation shortcuts to quickly access it:

- `G` then `T` - Navigate to table view (if configured in site.config.ts)

See [Keyboard Shortcuts](/features/keyboard-shortcuts) for all available shortcuts.
