## Core Framework: CODE

The book centers on four steps for managing knowledge:

- **Capture** — Save only what resonates, not everything
- **Organize** — Sort by actionability using PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archive)
- **Distill** — Use progressive summarization to surface key insights
- **Express** — Turn knowledge into creative output

## Key Concepts

- **Progressive summarization** — Layer highlights: bold the best parts, then highlight the boldest, creating quick-scan notes
- **Intermediate packets** — Break work into reusable components (outlines, drafts, research) that compound across projects
- **Slow burns vs heavy lifts** — Gather material gradually rather than all at once under deadline pressure

## The PARA Method

Organize everything into four categories based on actionability:

1. **Projects** — Active work with deadlines
2. **Areas** — Ongoing responsibilities without end dates
3. **Resources** — Topics of interest for future reference
4. **Archive** — Inactive items from the other three

## Connections

The methodology complements traditional Zettelkasten approaches. While BASB focuses on action and project delivery, [[building-a-second-brain-and-zettelkasten]] explores how combining it with Zettelkasten maximizes both productivity and deep knowledge building. See also [[second-brain-system]] for how these principles apply to this knowledge base.
