## Summary

Ado Kukic compiled 31 Claude Code tips shared throughout December into a single reference. The guide progresses from basics like `/init` and session management to advanced patterns including browser automation, plugins, and the Agent SDK.

## Key Concepts

- **Project onboarding**: Use `/init` to generate a `CLAUDE.md` file that helps Claude understand your codebase
- **Essential shortcuts**: `!` prefix for instant bash execution, `Escape` to rewind, `Ctrl+R` for reverse search
- **Session continuity**: Resume work with `--continue` or `--resume`, use named sessions for project context
- **Thinking modes**: Extended thinking with `ultrathink` and `megathink` for complex reasoning
- **Plan mode**: Structured approach for multi-step implementations
- **Headless automation**: Run Claude in CI/CD pipelines with `--print` flag
- **Browser integration**: Chrome extension enables web interaction through MCP tools
- **Extensibility**: Skills package reusable prompts, plugins add community functionality, SDK enables custom agents

## Core Philosophy

The guide emphasizes that Claude Code's value comes from user control. AI works as a lever—developers who structure prompts strategically and use plan mode find optimal leverage points. Collaboration beats automation.
