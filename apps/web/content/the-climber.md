## Overview

The Climber (孤高の人, Kokou no Hito) adapts Jiro Nitta's novel about Buntaro Mori, a withdrawn high school student who discovers solo climbing. Mountains become his refuge from social alienation and his path toward understanding himself.

## Themes

The manga examines what drives someone to pursue dangerous solitary goals. Mori's climbing obsession isolates him further from society while simultaneously giving his life purpose. Each ascent tests both physical limits and psychological endurance.

## Recognition

The series won the Excellence Prize in the Manga Division at the 14th Japan Media Arts Festival (2010). Sakamoto handled both story and art from volume 4 onward, bringing his distinctive realistic style to the mountain sequences.

## Connections

Shares thematic DNA with [[vagabond]]—both seinen works explore solitary protagonists seeking mastery through physical discipline, finding meaning in the pursuit itself rather than external validation.
