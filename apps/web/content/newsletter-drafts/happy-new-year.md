## Hey

I think it's been a long time since I wrote the last newsletter. But I decided that I want to now force myself to be more precise. I want to change some things regarding my blog and the way I write newsletters. Especially when it comes to blogging, I want to now take more time when I create a new blog post.

Also over the last month, beside all the normal stuff that always happens, I was so busy building things with Claude Code. At the moment I'm building two projects: a Vue workout tracker as a PWA → https://github.com/alexanderop/workoutTracker https://workout-tracker-ten-pi.vercel.app/ and a Second Brain that should be like an Obsidian clone with Nuxt 4, Nuxt Content and D3 → https://second-brain-nuxt.vercel.app/

Now in this newsletter I will share some of my latest blog posts and also related links that I found interesting.

I wish you all a good start in the new year.

## New Posts

- https://alexop.dev/posts/vue3_testing_pyramid_vitest_browser_mode/ — A useful testing strategy that I use for my own workout tracking app with Vitest browser integration tests mostly (I don't use the real IndexedDB)

- https://alexop.dev/posts/building_ai_qa_engineer_claude_code_playwright/ — I think something like this will be the future where we will include more AI agents to do quality checks, in this case QA

- https://alexop.dev/posts/why-you-dont-need-nuxt-mcp-claude-code/ — If you use Nuxt or any other library that needs documentation that is up to date, you should check out that post

## Curated Links

1. **[Markdown Editor](https://github.com/ccssmnn/alkalye)** — A friend of mine has coded a local-first markdown editor with Jazz. I think this is a nice little app. If you don't know what Jazz is, it's a framework that helps to sync data easily.

2. **[Boris Tips Claude Code](https://x.com/bcherny/status/2007179832300581177)** — The creator of Claude Code has shared how he uses Claude Code. Really good tips and I also follow a similar approach.

3. **[Nitro GraphQL](https://github.com/productdevbook/nitro-graphql)** — If you are a fan of GraphQL and Nitro (the backend that powers Nuxt), you should check out this newer open source project that helps you to use GraphQL with Nitro.

Best,
