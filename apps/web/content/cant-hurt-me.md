## Core Philosophy

Goggins argues that most people operate at only 40% of their capacity. The "40% Rule" states that when your mind tells you to quit, you've barely tapped your potential. True growth happens in the space between comfort and breaking point.

## Key Concepts

- **Callousing the Mind** — Deliberately seek discomfort to build mental resilience. Each hard thing you do deposits strength for future challenges.
- **The Accountability Mirror** — Face brutal truths about yourself without excuses. Write your goals on sticky notes and confront them daily.
- **The Cookie Jar** — Build a mental reserve of past victories to draw from when things get hard. Remember what you've already overcome.
- **Taking Souls** — Outwork everyone around you to the point where they can't ignore your effort. Demoralize obstacles through sheer persistence.

## Connections

Shares the military discipline ethos with [[extreme-ownership-jocko-willink-tedx]]. Both Goggins and Jocko Willink served as Navy SEALs and emphasize radical accountability.

The mental callusing concept complements the habit-stacking approach in [[atomic-habits]]—both build capability through consistent small actions.
