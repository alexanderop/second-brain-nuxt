summary: "Lee Robinson reflects on how coding agents have surpassed his coding ability and shares four recommendations for software engineers adapting to 2026."

## Context

Lee Robinson, now at Cursor after years at Vercel, built a Rust-based image compressor, a SvelteKit web app, and a hardware game for the Analog Pocket—all without writing code by hand. He used coding agents exclusively.

## Key Takeaways

**Models will get good at everything.** Don't assume your niche is safe. Rust, low-level code, computer science algorithms—models handle them now. Within a year, expect competence across most software engineering tasks.

**Eliminate drudge work first.** Shell scripts, JSON wrangling, cryptic error messages—offload the boring stuff. Coding agents excel at boilerplate. Focus your energy on what matters for the product.

**Become a generalist.** Code is cheap now. Taste matters more. Product engineers who blend coding with UX, marketing, and user research will thrive. Build something end-to-end: ship it, market it, grow it.

**Learn deliberately.** LLMs can trick you into thinking you understand something. Don't delegate your thinking. Ask the model to generate mini-courses, explain concepts layer by layer. Use it as an on-demand tutor, not a crutch.

## Notable Quotes

> "Writing code was never really the bottleneck, especially for larger projects."

> "It wasn't about the code... It's about building something great and something that I'm proud of."

This video captures the same shift described in [[12-factor-agents]] and [[building-effective-agents]]—the move from writing code to orchestrating agents. For practical tips on working with these tools, see [[claude-code-best-practices]] and [[how-i-use-llms]].
