## Overview

Real follows three men—each facing traumatic circumstances including a motorcycle accident, bone cancer, and a speeding truck collision—as they navigate their present, struggle, pause, and ultimately move forward. The series centers on wheelchair basketball as both a competitive sport and a vehicle for personal redemption.

## Why Read This

Takehiko Inoue brings the same artistic mastery and emotional depth from [[slam-dunk]] to a more mature, experimental narrative. With over 9 million copies sold in Japan for just the first 7 volumes, Real is critically acclaimed yet remains less internationally recognized than his earlier work. The series balances intense sports action with profound human drama.

## Themes

- **Overcoming adversity** - Characters confront life-changing disabilities and find new paths forward
- **Purpose through competition** - Wheelchair basketball becomes a means of reclaiming agency and identity
- **Vulnerability and strength** - Explores what it means to be "real" when facing your limitations
