## Core Framework

There is **one neural circuit** responsible for pursuing all goals, regardless of type. It involves four brain areas:

1. **Amygdala** - Anxiety and fear (motivation to avoid punishment)
2. **Basal ganglia** - Go/no-go action initiation
3. **Lateral prefrontal cortex** - Planning across timescales
4. **Orbitofrontal cortex** - Emotional state assessment

**Dopamine** is the common currency for assessing value and progress toward goals.

## The 85% Rule for Optimal Learning

When learning something new, set difficulty so you succeed ~85% of the time and fail ~15%. This error rate is optimal for neuroplasticity - errors queue up brain areas to be more alert on subsequent attempts.

- Not so easy you're always succeeding
- Not so hard you're failing half the time
- ~15% failure rate is the sweet spot

## Key Principles

### Peripersonal vs Extrapersonal Space
- **Peripersonal space** - Within arm's reach; activates one visual system
- **Extrapersonal space** - Beyond arm's reach; activates goal-pursuit visual system

Focusing your eyes on a specific point in extrapersonal space activates the neural circuits for goal pursuit and releases dopamine.

### Visual Focus Protocol
Narrowing visual focus to a specific target:
- Increases alertness and arousal
- Activates the autonomic nervous system
- Creates a "readiness state" for action
- Can be used deliberately before tackling difficult tasks

### Dopamine and Motivation
- Dopamine is released in anticipation of rewards, not just upon receiving them
- The pursuit itself can be rewarding when properly framed
- Avoid excessive reward after goal completion - it can diminish future motivation

## Four Protocols for Goal Achievement

1. **Set specific, measurable goals** - Vague goals don't activate the neural circuits effectively
2. **Use visual focus** - Literally focus your eyes on a target to activate goal-pursuit circuits
3. **Maintain moderate difficulty** - Aim for 85% success rate
4. **Manage dopamine properly** - Don't over-reward completion; keep some drive for the next goal

## Notable Quotes

> "There is one neural circuit responsible for pursuing all goals... it doesn't matter what the goal is, the same circuits are involved."

> "Dopamine is the common currency by which we assess our progress toward particular things of particular value."

> "When you make errors, in the immediate seconds and minutes after those errors, you are in a better position to learn."
