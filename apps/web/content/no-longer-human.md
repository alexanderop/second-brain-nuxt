## Overview

Ōba Yōzō narrates his life through three notebooks, chronicling his descent from a troubled childhood marked by performance and deception to a fractured adulthood plagued by alcoholism, failed suicide attempts, and institutionalization. He masks his inner emptiness by playing the clown, believing himself incapable of genuine human connection.

## Key Themes

- **Alienation from self and society** — Yōzō sees himself as fundamentally different from other humans, unable to understand their motivations or feel what they feel
- **The mask of performance** — Survival through constant role-playing, pretending to be what others expect
- **Shame as a defining emotion** — Not guilt over wrongdoing but shame over one's very existence
- **Self-destruction as escape** — Alcohol, drugs, and suicide attempts as responses to unbearable consciousness

## Notable Aspect

The title "No Longer Human" (人間失格, *Ningen Shikkaku*) translates literally as "Disqualified as a Human Being." Dazai completed the novel shortly before his own suicide in 1948, lending the work an autobiographical weight that intensifies its emotional impact.
