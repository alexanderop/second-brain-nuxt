## Overview

Vagabond adapts Eiji Yoshikawa's novel "Musashi," following the historical swordsman Miyamoto Musashi through Sengoku-era Japan. After barely surviving the Battle of Sekigahara, the young Takezo transforms into Musashi and embarks on a journey to become "invincible under the sun."

## Why Read This

Takehiko Inoue's magnum opus showcases his artistic peak—detailed ink work that rivals classical paintings, with fight choreography that captures both brutality and beauty. While [[slam-dunk]] proved his storytelling talent and [[real]] explored emotional depth, Vagabond synthesizes everything into a meditation on violence, purpose, and what it means to be truly strong.

## Themes

- **The meaning of strength** - Musashi's pursuit of martial supremacy gradually shifts toward inner mastery
- **Violence and consequence** - Every duel carries weight; survival demands both skill and philosophy
- **Rivalry as growth** - The parallel journey of Sasaki Kojiro provides a mirror to Musashi's path
