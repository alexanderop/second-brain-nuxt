summary: "Markdown has become a general-purpose programming language—AI agents like Claude Code compile structured specifications into working applications."

## Summary

AI coding agents have turned Markdown into a legitimate programming language. Instead of writing implementation code, developers compose structured requirements that AI agents compile into working applications. Charles argues this represents a 10x productivity jump comparable to Assembly → C or C → Python.

## Key Points

- **Markdown as high-level language**: Natural language specifications formatted in Markdown represent a higher abstraction than traditional code
- **AI as compiler**: Tools like Claude Code and Cursor CLI act as compilers, translating specs into multi-language application stacks
- **Economic advantage**: A blog platform via Markdown specs costs ~$676 versus ~$5,760 with traditional development
- **Limits remain**: Novel algorithms, performance-critical code, cryptography, and systems programming still require direct implementation
