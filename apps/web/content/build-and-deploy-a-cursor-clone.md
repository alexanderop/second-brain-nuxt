## Key Takeaways

- Build a functional AI code editor similar to Cursor from scratch
- Learn Next.js 16 patterns with React for the frontend interface
- Use Convex as a real-time backend database solution
- Integrate AI capabilities into a code editing environment

## Tech Stack

| Technology | Role |
|------------|------|
| Next.js 16 | React framework with App Router |
| React | UI components and state management |
| Convex | Real-time backend and database |
| AI Integration | Code assistance features |

## What You'll Build

A Cursor-inspired IDE clone that combines:
- Code editor interface with syntax highlighting
- AI-powered code suggestions and completions
- Real-time collaboration capabilities via Convex
- Full deployment workflow

## Why This Matters

Cursor popularized the concept of AI-native code editors. Understanding how to build one reveals the architecture behind AI coding tools—from prompt engineering for code context to real-time sync between editor state and backend.

## Connections

This is the first note using Next.js and Convex in the knowledge base—it stands alone for now but establishes a foundation for future web development and AI tooling notes.
