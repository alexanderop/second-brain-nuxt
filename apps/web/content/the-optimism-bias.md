Neuroscientist Tali Sharot examines the brain's built-in tendency toward optimism—why we expect better outcomes than evidence supports, and how this bias affects everything from financial decisions to health choices.

## Why Read This

The optimism bias is one of the most consistent cognitive biases across cultures and ages. Understanding it illuminates why we underestimate risks, overcommit to projects, and maintain hope against the odds. Sharot draws on her research at UCL and MIT to show both the benefits (resilience, motivation) and costs (poor planning, unrealistic expectations) of our rose-tinted neural wiring.
