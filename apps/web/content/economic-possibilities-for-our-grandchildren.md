summary: "Keynes' 1930 essay predicting that by 2030, technological progress would raise living standards 8x and reduce the workweek to 15 hours—freeing humanity from 'the economic problem' but raising new questions about purpose."

Written in 1930 amid the Great Depression, Keynes rejected the prevailing pessimism about economic progress. He saw the crisis as "growing-pains of over-rapid changes" rather than permanent decline.

## The Prediction

Keynes projected that within 100 years (by 2030), living standards in developed nations would rise eightfold. This dramatic increase would come from compounding gains in technology and capital accumulation—forces he traced back only to around 1700, noting that the previous 4,000 years saw almost no improvement in average living standards.

With material needs met, he envisioned a 15-hour workweek. The rest of life would be devoted to leisure and culture.

## Two Types of Needs

Keynes distinguished between:

- **Absolute needs** — what we require regardless of others (food, shelter, health). These can be satisfied.
- **Relative needs** — what we want only to feel superior to others. These are insatiable.

He believed technology would solve the first category, making the second irrelevant for most people.

## The Real Challenge

Keynes worried less about whether we'd achieve abundance and more about how we'd handle it. If work has oriented human purpose for millennia, what happens when that orientation dissolves?

He predicted moral codes would shift. The accumulation of wealth, long valued as virtue, would lose its social importance. New values would need to emerge.

## How Accurate Was He?

His economic prediction landed remarkably close. GDP in industrialized nations increased 4-8x since 1930, roughly matching his forecast.

The 15-hour workweek never materialized. Six explanations dominate:

1. People prefer consumption over leisure
2. Modern hobbies cost more than contemplation
3. Relative status still drives behavior
4. Work has become more enjoyable for many
5. Entrepreneurs keep inventing desirable goods
6. Inequality means many still struggle with basic needs

The economic problem persists not because we failed to grow, but because growth didn't distribute the way Keynes assumed.

## Connections

Keynes' vision of technological unemployment resonates with current debates about AI displacing workers. [[the-age-of-the-generalist]] argues that AI commoditizes specialist tasks while rewarding high-agency generalists—a modern twist on Keynes' question of what work means when machines can do more. [[ai-codes-better-than-me-now-what]] confronts the same question for software engineers: when AI codes better than you, what's left?

The difference: Keynes imagined liberation from work. Today's conversation centers on adaptation within work.
