  how to tweet

  8 months ago i'd never written a single tweet in my life. today my DMs are full of people messaging me about my content... not just because it's valuable but because of how it's written.

  what i'm about to break down won't work for absolutely everyone, but it works for most people trying to build an audience that generates real business.

  there are tons of ways to grow on this platform, my strategy is simple: post a shit ton of high-value content every single day.

  first thing you need to know: a brilliant insight doesn't automatically turn into a great tweet. i still post incredibly valuable stuff that completely flops because my writing wasn't tight or the algorithm decided to ignore it that day.

  so what actually matters when you sit down to write?

  > it needs to be genuinely valuable

  this sounds painfully obvious but you can't just regurgitate advice that's been floating around for years. i see the same recycled tips everywhere... stuff said a thousand times and it won't make anyone stop scrolling.

  you need to dig into your experience and pull out insights that are fresh. things that haven't been beaten to death across the platform. ideas that could genuinely shift how someone approaches their work or thinks about their business.

  the difference between content that gets ignored and content that gets saved is whether you're saying something new or at least saying something old in a way that makes people see it differently.

  ask yourself before posting: would i bookmark this if someone else wrote it? if the answer is no, keep working on it.

  > it needs to be immediately actionable

  an insight without a blueprint is basically entertainment, not education. i see tweets constantly like "wow this new ChatGPT update is absolutely insane" with zero context or application. maybe it gets views if you're lucky... but it brings in almost no followers and definitely zero business opportunities.

  people don't follow you because you noticed something, they follow you because you taught them how to use it.

  so if you're writing about that ChatGPT update, don't just point at it. write "how to write copy that sounds human with GPT-5.2:" and then walk through the actual process. step by step, line by line, exactly how to implement it in their workflow.

  people will read the entire thing because you're not just giving them information, you're giving them a system.

  do this consistently and some percentage of your followers will want to hire you because they've already seen proof you know what you're talking about. the tweets become your portfolio.

  > it needs to spark natural engagement

  this is where most people mess up because they think engagement means begging for it. "like if you agree" or "retweet this if you found it helpful" just makes you look desperate.

  you want your tweet structured in a way that naturally creates replies and bookmarks without asking.

  bookmarks happen automatically when your hook uses phrases like "here's how" or "how to" or "do this" because you have maybe one second to stop someone mid-scroll and a ton of people operate on autopilot... they see something that looks useful, bookmark it for later, keep scrolling.

  for replies, you've got two main approaches:
  - push your opinion harder and take a clear controversial stance
  - keep it slightly open and invite perspective

  both strategies work, you just need to pick which one fits the content better.

  > it needs to be ridiculously easy to read

  this seems super basic but it's the difference between someone reading your whole tweet or bouncing in half a second. most people scroll through their feed at insane speeds, their eyes land on your tweet for maybe one second before deciding whether to engage.

  your hook needs to be short and punchy, ideally one line that clearly signals what value you're about to deliver. "how to X" or "why X doesn't work" or "the X mistake you're making"

  after that, use one sentence per line whenever possible. this creates natural rhythm and makes everything way easier to process visually.

  throw in lists using "-" or ">" or "1." to organize complex information into digestible pieces.

  white space matters. the space between your lines and sections gives people's eyes a place to rest.

  simplify everything as much as you possibly can. aim for a conversational tone like you're a mentor talking to students.

  use "use" instead of "utilize". say "help" instead of "facilitate". write "get better" instead of "optimize performance".

  if your 14-year-old cousin couldn't understand your tweet, it's probably too complex.

  > you need to develop your own recognizable style

  when i scroll through my feed i see the exact same content written in the exact same style everywhere. same hooks, same structure, same voice. it all blends together into this generic AI-sounding content soup.

  but when someone has a writing style i can identify instantly, a structure that screams "this is them"... i stop scrolling completely.

  your style is what makes people remember you.

  maybe you always use ">" to break down processes. maybe you start most tweets with a specific pattern. maybe you write in fragments sometimes for emphasis.

  these little patterns become your signature, and people start recognizing your tweets before they even see your name.

  the key is consistency without being formulaic.

  and when you nail all of this consistently... you build an audience that respects your ideas, not just your follower count.
