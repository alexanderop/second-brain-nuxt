  Is it just me?

  My entire timeline is filled with AI coding tweets, nothing about specific tech or any actual code like there used to be.

  Maybe the algorithm put me in a bubble here…

## Thread Discussion

The tweet sparked a significant discussion about the state of tech Twitter/X, with many developers expressing similar frustrations.

### Fatigue with AI Hype

**ThePrimeagen**: "I am trying not to crash about this exact topic. It feels exhausting"

**Julia Turc**: "Soul crushing, just brainless blanket statements about how insane this and that model is with no informational content whatsoever"

Michael's response: "The hype without anything interesting to say is the part that bothers me"

### The Engagement Problem

**Palash Bansal** highlighted a core issue: actual coding posts get 100-200 views, while AI coding posts with no meaningful content get thousands. This creates a perverse incentive for content creators.

### Identity Shift

**Adam** offered a candid perspective: "I mean, I used to code, so I talked about coding. Now I AI code so I talk about AI coding"

**Theo** added humor: "We have nothing else to do when we're waiting for our generations to finish"

### Observations

The thread reveals a tension in the developer community: genuine interest in AI tools vs. frustration with low-signal hype content. Several responses suggest the algorithm amplifies AI content regardless of substance, creating a feedback loop that drowns out technical depth.
