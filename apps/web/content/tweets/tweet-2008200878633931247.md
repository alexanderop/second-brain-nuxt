Video breakdown (16:23) of the Ralph Wiggum technique - a KISS approach to autonomous AI coding with [[claude-code]].

## Key Insights from Thread

- Uses `.json` for PRD and `.txt` for progress (copied from Anthropic's approach)
- Uses plan mode to create the PRD
- Strong typing emphasized throughout
- Community variations: some use SQLite instead of text files for faster queries
- Works with Obsidian Task Queue similarly to `/ralph` command
