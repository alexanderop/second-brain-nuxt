tweetText: "Tailwind lays off 75% of their team. The reason is so ironic: their CSS framework became extremely popular with AI coding agents (75m downloads/mo), meaning nobody would visit their docs where they promoted paid offerings, resulting in 40% drop in traffic & 80% revenue loss."

This tweet illustrates the [[ai-paradox-destroying-businesses]] - when AI adoption of your product actually undermines your revenue model.

The irony: Tailwind's success with AI agents (75M downloads/month) cannibalized their documentation traffic where they monetized through paid offerings.
