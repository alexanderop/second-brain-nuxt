DHH reflects on his shifting perspective on AI coding assistance. In a prior conversation with Lex Fridman, he resisted letting AI write code directly - but now admits the resistance was partly because models weren't good enough. He used to spend more time rewriting AI output than writing from scratch. That has now flipped.

A call to embrace AI with curiosity rather than skepticism heading into 2026.
