Tilly solves a familiar problem: your friend mentions a job interview, you genuinely care, but weeks pass and you never ask how it went. The app gives you a dedicated space to log these moments and receive reminders to check in.

## Core Features

- **People & Notes** - Store details about each person: birthdays, interests, life updates, photos
- **Reminders** - Automated nudges to reach out at the right time
- **Cross-device Sync** - Works across all your devices with push notifications
- **Data Control** - Client-side encryption, offline mode, full data export

## Tilly Agent (Plus)

The Plus tier ($6/month) adds an AI assistant that organizes your notes and suggests actions using natural language input.

## Why Not Just Use Contacts or Notes?

Tilly creates separation from work tools and social media noise. It reduces the mental overhead of friendship maintenance by surfacing the right person at the right time.

## Open Source

Available on GitHub under an open license, giving you full control over your data.
