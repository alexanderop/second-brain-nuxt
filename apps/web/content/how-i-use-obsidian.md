summary: "Steph Ango's personal note-taking system emphasizes file-based storage, minimal folder hierarchy, and emergent organization through linking rather than rigid structure."

Steph Ango stores all his notes as plain Markdown files in a single folder, embracing the "file over app" philosophy. This approach prioritizes long-term accessibility over any particular tool's features.

## Key Principles

**Minimal structure over elaborate folders.** Rather than nested hierarchies, notes use a `categories` property in frontmatter. Flat organization reduces friction when creating and finding notes.

**Links as organization.** Internal links—including unresolved ones—create breadcrumbs for future connections. The structure emerges from relationships rather than predetermined categories.

**Templates for consistency.** Nearly every note starts from a template containing structured metadata: dates, people, themes, locations, and ratings on a 1-7 scale.

## Fractal Journaling

Daily notes compile into weekly reviews, which feed monthly summaries, then yearly reflections. Each layer aggregates patterns from the layer below, revealing trends invisible at finer granularity.

## Publishing Workflow

The site itself publishes directly from Obsidian through Jekyll and Netlify. Markdown stays the source of truth while generating HTML output.

This approach aligns with [[evergreen-notes]], which emphasizes atomic structure and dense linking over hierarchical organization. Both systems let meaning emerge from connections rather than imposed categories.
