# Writing Style Guidelines

Based on "Economical Writing" by Deirdre N. McCloskey. Apply these principles when writing summaries, insights, and note content.

## The 10 Rules

### 1. Be Clear
Clarity is speed directed at the point. Bad writing makes slow reading. When explaining complex topics, give your reader every help possible.

### 2. Use Active Verbs
Not "Active verbs should be used" (passive, cowardly). Rather: "Use active verbs" (direct, clear). Verbs make English—pick active, accurate, lively ones.

### 3. Avoid Boilerplate
Never start with filler like "This note will explore..." or "In this summary, we will...". Cut the throat-clearing and get to the point.

### 4. One Point Per Paragraph
Each paragraph should be a complete discussion of one topic. Don't scatter ideas across paragraphs or cram multiple ideas into one.

### 5. Make Writing Cohere
Writing should hang together from phrases to entire documents. Use transitions and logical flow so the reader can follow without backtracking.

### 6. Avoid Elegant Variation
Don't swap synonyms to seem sophisticated. If you mean "book", say "book" every time—not "tome", "volume", "work", "publication". Clarity trumps elegance.

### 7. Watch Punctuation
- Colon (:) means "to be specific"
- Semicolon (;) means "likewise" or "also"
- Use commas after introductory phrases

### 8. End Sentences with the Point
The end of a sentence is the emphatic location. Rearrange so the main point lands last. "The emphatic location is the end of the sentence" → "The end is the place of emphasis."

### 9. Replace Vague Pronouns
Avoid "this", "that", "these", "those" when they're unclear. Often plain "the" works better, or name the thing explicitly. "This led to that, which caused these problems" → name what led, what it led to, what problems.

### 10. Write the Way You Speak
Use everyday words. A strength, not a weakness. "Utilize" → "use". "Commence" → "start". "Facilitate" → "help". Don't dress up plain ideas in fancy words.
